abstract = {The key design challenges in the construction of a SAT-based relational model finder are described, and novel techniques are proposed to address them. An efficient model finder must have a mechanism for specifying partial solutions, an effective symmetry detection and breaking scheme, and an economical translation from relational to boolean logic. These desiderata are addressed with three new techniques: a symmetry detection algorithm that works in the presence of partial solutions, a sparse-matrix representation of relations, and a compact representation of boolean formulas inspired by boolean expression diagrams and reduced boolean circuits. The presented techniques have been implemented and evaluated, with promising results.},

Properties are described as Haskell functions, and can be automatically tested on random input, but it is also possible to define custom test data generators. We present a number of case studies, in which the tool was successfully used, and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random testing is especially suitable for functional programs because properties can be stated at a fine grain. When a function is built from separately tested components, then random testing suffices to obtain good coverage of the definition under test.},

While the generation of counterexamples is an undecidable problem, recent methods have shown that it is possible to generate counterexamples to conjectures for many interesting problems. This tutorial will review current counterexample generation technology and how it can be used to design, analyze, and reason about systems. The tutorial will include a demo using ACL2s, the ACL2 Sedan. During the tutorial, we will also discuss the pedagogical use of counterexample generation in ACL2s to help freshmen students learn about logic and program verification. Finally, we will discuss future research opportunities.",

abstract = {Inductive relations offer a powerful and expressive way of writing   program specifications while facilitating compositional reasoning.   Their widespread use by proof assistant users has made them a   particularly attractive target for proof engineering tools such as   QuickChick, a property-based testing tool for Coq which can   automatically derive generators for values satisfying an inductive   relation.   However, while such generators are generally efficient, there is   an infrequent yet seemingly inevitable situation where their   performance greatly degrades: when multiple inductive relations   constrain the same piece of data.    In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for merging two such   inductively defined properties that share an index. The algorithm   finds shared structure between the two relations, and creates a   single merged relation that is provably equivalent to the   conjunction of the two.   We demonstrate, through a series of case studies,   that the merged relations can improve the performance of automatic   generation by orders of magnitude, as well as simplify mechanized   proofs by getting rid of the need for nested induction and tedious   low-level book-keeping.},
